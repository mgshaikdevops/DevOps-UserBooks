VERSION CONTROL SYTEM
=======================

Oct2020 Central Repo:	https://github.com/mgshaikdevops/Oct2020.git

===============
Configuration:
===============
git config --global user.name "mgshaikdevops"
git config --global user.email "mgshaikdevops@gmail.com"
git config --global push.default "simple"

========================
User/Developer Workflow
========================

git clone https://github.com/mgshaikdevops/Oct2020.git  [path to download]

create a file and check status 
you can also create a directory and add the files inside the directory
git add [file] or add . [all files to add ]
git commit -m "first commit" or second ,thirt etc

git log [for all commit id's] 
git log -1 [for one and latest commit id]  
git log --oneline [it will show only single line view]
git log --oneline [for one and latest commit id]
git log -num
git show <commit id>

======================================================================================
PUSH TO THE CENTRAL REPOSITORY ONLY WHEN YOU FINISH with your work in local repository
======================================================================================
git push OR origin master
git pull [we have to use pull when we have to update every file from different workspaces]


==========================================
BRANCHES switching, Merging and Deleting
==========================================

git branch [to check on which branch you are]

git branch <new branch name> [to create a new branch]
when you create a new branch at that time it will add all the files from the parent branch 

git checkout <branch name> [checkout we use for switching from one branch to another branch]
[When you create some files in a branch those files will only be in that perticular branch]

git merge <source branch> <destination branch(normally it is master in most cases)>
[it will merge all the files from that branch]

[always go to destination(master will be destination branch in most cases) branch and from there you run the command]
[when you are in destination branch just give source branch]
git merge <source branch>

when you merge it will ask you to write a commit message for your reference then save it in default editor

when you want to merge the same file from the different branches there will be a CONFLIX in that case if it is in 
-->local repository then it will be a developer most of the time so he must know which one to merge OR if there is some changes then he must do manual merge in the editor and after that file he must commit.
-->central repository then you must ask for the owner of the repository or who worked with that file.


git cherry-pick <commitID> 
[to merge only single file from that branch for that you must go to the perticular branch and find the commitID]

git branch -d test


when you fnish writing your scripts you have to do UNIT TEST.

=====================
STASH (BACKUP & UNDO)
=====================

create stash, remove changes from working directory
git stash

to list all stash available for the repository
git stash list

reapply the changes, remove stash
git stash pop

apply a specific stash from repo
git stash apply stash@{IndexNumber}

Idea22 | Idea11 |      |
Index0   Index1	 Index2  Index3

remove stash from repo
git stash clear

=============
RESET [undo]
=============

git reset --soft (repository reference)
git reset --mixed (repo+staging area)
git reset --hard (repo+SA+WorkingDirectory)

=====
TAGS
=====

Git has the option to tag a commit in the repository history so that you find it easier at a later point in time.

apply tag to a commit:
git tag -a <pattern> -m 'comment' <commitid>

contetns of the tag:
git show <pattern>

display list of tags available:
git tag

push the tags:
git push --tags

deletea tag:
git tag -d <tag> 

=======
REBASE
=======
step1:
create test branch
create a commit ID on master
create 2 commit ID's on test
rebase
git checkout test
git rebase master

step2:
git checkout master
git rebase test

=========================================
PUSH/PULL changes other than central repo
=========================================

list the remote reference
git remote -v

add a new remote reference
git remote add <ReferenceName> <NewRemoteURL>

checkout the source repo branch to a non working branch
git checkout <branch>

pull a change:
git pull <ReferenceName> <Branch>

push a change
git push <ReferenceName> <Branch>


Central Repo (BARE) : Store and share
Local Repo (NONBARE): Modify, store and share

====================
BUILD MANAGEMENT
====================

A process where we convert the raw code written by devopers in any of the programming language and converting them in to a machine understanble format and later on we assemble all the files which we have converted in to the machine understanble format and from that we create a software together that complete process we call it as build management or building a product.

===============
build process : 2 steps
===============
1.compilation: converting java files into class files we call it as compilation.
2.assembly: creating jar[java archaea]/war[web archaea]/ear[enterprise archaea]

compilation : raw source code ---> object files(binary files) 
assembly 

compilation ---> object files(binary files) ---> Packeging ---> Deliverables(JAR, WAR) Build Artifact(application)(machine readable format))

==========================================================================
MAVEN - Project Management Tool - Build tool - Dependency Management Tool
==========================================================================

Maven takes care of complete dependency of our project and it works as a depency management system.

pom.xml: every project must have Maven configuration file along with java files that file we call it as pom.xml

=============
install java: 
=============
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openjdk-8-jdk
java -version

==============
install maven:
==============
apt update 
apt install maven
mvn -version

Create a template of a project:
=================================
mvn archetype:generate

mvn compile
mvn test
mvn package
mvn install [install step we have to do it only when we want to share the project]
mvn deploy
mvn clean [delete the entire target folder to clean the workspace]

======================
CONTINUOS DEVELOPMENT
======================

Release planning
agile scrum sprint planning
setup distributed version control system
branching strategy
define developer workflow policies
dockerize the components/product.

TOOLS: GIT - GITHUB - GITLAB - JIRA - DOCKERFILE -JBOSS

=======
GITLAB
=======
Create account in gitlab.com - cloud
add an public ssh key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
create a project (central repository)
import project
add members
give project level permissions
create branches
protect branches
backup & restore (https://docs.gitlab.com/eeraketasks/backup restore.html)
  sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:create

====================================================
GITLAB: https://gitlab.com/mgshaikdevops/oct2020.git
====================================================

===========
CI PROCESS
===========

once developer writes the code(jar,war and etc) he will do the unit test and then he will be checking in the code and he will be pushing the code.

when the developer writes the code in to the repository that will be called as source code.

==============
BUILD PROCESS: 
==============
software build is a process where we convert the raw source code in to the binary format file which machines can understand.

binary format file : we call this as application 

===============
DEVELOPER BUILD
===============
gitlab ---> clone ---> source code ---> build 2 steps ---> compilation ---> object files(binary files) ---> Packeging ---> Artifact(application)(jar,war etc) --->  Unit Test(Developer will test after the Artifact(machine readable format)) ---> check in and push to central repository

collection of obj files we call it as deliverable artifact. 

Package: combining all the obj files and create a single package.

===================================================
Nightly Build or Full Product Build or Formal Buid
===================================================
gitlab ---> clone ---> source code ---> build 2 steps ---> compilation ---> object files(binary files) ---> Packeging ---> Deliverables(JAR, WAR) Build Artifact(application)(machine readable format)) ---> THEN GIVE TO THE CUSTOMER.

When we build we get either JAR OR WAR file.
JAR: JAVA ARCHAEA
WAR: WEB ARCHAEA
EAR: ENTERPRISE AECHAEA

=============
TESTING TYPES
=============
unit testing: done by developers
------------
integration testing: done by automated process [developer if he knows or devops enginner]
--------------------
system testing: done by QA testing team
---------------
regression testing:  
-------------------
quick round of testing in which you are going to check weather your old functionties are also working along with the new functionality. u need to merge the code and generate a new build to do this..

user aceeptance testing: 
------------------------
before giving it to the customer we check the final testing with a customer(by invitation) (beta versions released called as user acceptance testing)

================================
Configure After the Installation
================================

Configure the system settings:
------------------------------
Home Directory : /var/lib/jenkins [its jenkins home directory where all the jenkins data stored]

Jenkins URL: http://PublicIPAddress:8080/
Environment variables: 
Set up on master 
Name: JAVA_HOME
Value: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64 [MysystemPath using which java and ls -al ]

=========================
Global Tool Configuration
=========================

Set Up JDK Installations:
-------------------------

Name: jdk11 [Name to identify]
JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64 [Same path as above]

Set Up Git:
-----------
Name: Mygit[what you like]
Path to Git executable: /usr/bin/git


=======================
Manage Nodes and Clouds
=======================

You have to setup nodes based on the Job 

Now Configure Nodes for Build

Nodes/slaves/Machines [When the memory supports you can add many machines ]


I have 2 branches which is CI and Nightly Build Job
for example:
one machine have have 5 gb of RAM now if you want to run one task like build task you would requre 2 gb so in this machine we have 2 tasks so in this case you use 4gb so you can only use executors. 
Executors: 2 

Label : BuildGroup2[set of machines under one group]

Remote Root Directory: /tmp/jenkins [Its up to the organization where they want to make a direcotry i created jenkins directory in tmp]

Host: Private IPv4 addresses 

Now the node machines should have successfully connected to the master.

============================================
Creating and connecting NODES from LOCALHOST
============================================
create and name the node

Remote root directory: /tmp/jenkins [Create a directory for the jenkins ]

Launch method: 
Host: Private IPv4 addresses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
before adding all the details to the NODE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goto slave node switch to the root user

sudo su

Add a user to jenkins home using

useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins

Here /var/lib/jenkins is having my home directory

Now, from jenkins master copy the id inside id_rsa.pub from jenkins user

cat /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Now, create an authorized_keys file for jenkins user form slave node

mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh

And create an authorized_keys file

vi /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys

Paste the id that you have copied from id_rsa.pub here and save the file with “:wq!”.


https://intellipaat.com/community/3952/why-jenkins-says-server-rejected-the-1-private-key-s-while-launching-the-agent
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Credentials: add credentials using username and password give username and password 

Now the node machines should have successfully connected to the master.



=============
Creating Jobs
=============
FreeStyle 

FirstJob:

tick:
✅ This project is parameterised
✅ Restrict where this project can be run and select the labelgroup
✅ Restrict where this project can be run and select the label
=====================================================================================================================
✅ Build periodically if you want automate by time for example 
=====================================================================================================================
MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW
MINUTE	Minutes within the hour (0–59)
HOUR	The hour of the day (0–23)
DOM	The day of the month (1–31)
MONTH	The month (1–12)
DOW	The day of the week (0–7) where 0 and 7 are Sunday.
To specify multiple values for one field, the following operators are available. In the order of precedence,

* specifies all valid values
M-N specifies a range of values
M-N/X or */X steps by intervals of X through the specified range or whole valid range
A,B,...,Z enumerates multiple values
====================================================================================================================

✅ execute shell: 
command:

echo "HI"  --->BUILD NOW AND IT SHOULD BE SUCCESS.

Post Build Actions:

Build Other Projects
Projects to buid: SecondJob [Name of the job]

downstream dependancy: when the first job finished successfully then the second job will start this is called downstream dependancy.

upstream dependency:

Project is parameterized: 
DefaultValue: if we give default value for nightly build it will successfully build other wise it will fail.

Trigger when build is: 
Stable :when build is successfull or previous execution of the job is successfull.
Unstable: if it is failing for the first time 
Build Fails: If it is continuosly keeps failing

if you give stable then when you run the FirstJob if it fails then the SecondJob will not run
if you give unstable then when you run the FirstJob if it fails then the SecondJob will run
if you give BuildFails then when you run the FirstJob if it fails then the SecondJob will not run

-------> when you build it should be invoking to the SecondJob

==============================================
Trigger Parameterized build on other projects:
==============================================
Current Build Parameters: it will take the current parameters of the the firstjob in that case in second job we must have the same parameters aswell otherwise it will not call the parameters.
Predefined Parameters: we can define the parameters before the execution in firstjob so that second job will use those parameter values from firstjob.



==============================================================
CI Build will get triggered Every checkin happends [Poll SCM]
==============================================================

=============================================================================
Nightly build should happened on a fixed scheduled time [Build Periodically]
=============================================================================


CI Job is called as Incremental Build: 

jenkins pipeline:

Pipeline---> Agent[globala value] --> Stages --> Steps

pipeline

==================
logical Operators
==================
AND : all of 
------------
true AND true 	= true
true AND false  = false
false AND true 	= false
false AND false = false
-------------
OR  : any of
-------------
true OR true 	= true
true OR flase 	= true
false OR true 	= true
false OR false 	= false

==================
parallel stages
===================
Stages in Declarative Pipeline may declare a number of nested stages within them, which will be
executed in parallel. Note that a stage must have one and only one of either steps or parallel. The
nested stages cannot contain further parallel stages themselves, but otherwise behave the same as
any other stage. Any stage containing parallel cannot contain agent or tools, since those are not
relevant without steps.
In addition, you can force your parallel stage`s to all be aborted when one of them fails, by
adding `failFast true to the stage containing the parallel.

======
post
======
The post section defines one or more additional steps that are run upon the completion of a
Pipeline’s or stage’s run (depending on the location of the post section within the Pipeline). post can
support one of the following post-condition blocks: always, changed, failure, success, unstable, and
aborted. These condition blocks allow the execution of steps within the post section depending on
the completion status of the Pipeline or stage.
